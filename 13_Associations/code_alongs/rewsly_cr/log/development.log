Mr Rudd said that the money would go into services like music programs, supervised sport and homework clubs.\nAdvertisement\nHe said the before and after school plan would have a \"triple benefit\" in providing better services for children, more flexibility for parents and boosting employment participation - in particular, for women.\nEmployment Participation Minister Kate Ellis said the funding would provide about 68,000 extra places for school children.\n\"This is a good announcement but it is a very smart investment,\" she said.\nLast month, Fairfax Media reported a crisis in after hours school care places in parts of Sydney, where children were waiting years to gain access.\nMs Ellis said that services would tender to get access to the funding.\n\nRead more: http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/federal-election-2013/government-spends-450m-on-after-hours-school-care-20130805-2r99u.html#ixzz2b4cdwG00\n"], ["created_at", Mon, 05 Aug 2013 10:10:03 UTC +00:00], ["headline", "$450 million for after school care"], ["updated_at", Mon, 05 Aug 2013 10:10:03 UTC +00:00]]

He'd surf, party, promote his sponsor, then move on to the next wall of water. By 2002, though, he'd retired to Bali where, one typically sultry morning, he paddled out towards the thundering surf break at Uluwatu, off the holiday island's southernmost peninsula, Bukit. Approaching the break, he could barely believe what he was seeing.\n\"It was a big day - 10, 12 feet,\" Campbell recalls. \"It was heavy. Gnarly. Not many people surf it [at that size]. But there was a guy out there I didn't recognise. He took off on a huge wave and surfed it to perfection. I'd surfed with the best in the world, and this guy was one of the best I'd seen ...
